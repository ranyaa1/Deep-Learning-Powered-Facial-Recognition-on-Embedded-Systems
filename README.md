ðŸš€ A Deep Learning-Based Facial Recognition Attendance System on STM32F7 Microcontroller

This project is the **second part** of my undergraduate capstone project (2023), focused on implementing an embedded system capable of facial recognition and interactive display, using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and the **STM32F7** platform.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Project Overview

This smart attendance system combines **deep learning** and **embedded development** to identify individuals based on their facial features. It offers a standalone, low-power, and efficient attendance solution without relying on external computing systems.

## ðŸ”§ Components and Tasks

### ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Facial Recognition using CNN
- A custom-trained CNN model capable of recognizing individual faces with high accuracy.
- Trained in Python using Keras/TensorFlow.
- The model is exported and optimized for embedded deployment using STM32Cube.AI.

### ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Message Display on STM32F7
- Displays real-time feedback such as "Welcome, Rania!" or "Access Denied" directly on the LCD screen.
- Interfaced with STM32's HAL libraries.

### ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Image Rendering on STM32F7
- Renders stored images of registered users for confirmation.
- Optimized bitmap display pipeline using DMA and SDRAM.

### ðŸ”¹ Task 4: Model Deployment with STM32Cube.AI
- The CNN model is quantized and converted into a C array.
- Integrated into STM32 IDE using STM32Cube.AI tools.
- Executed inference in real-time within the microcontroller.
